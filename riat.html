		<h1>The Recording Industry Association of T.Tian</h1>
		<h3>A Dynamic Personal Music Archive</h3>
		<p>Like any devoted music lover, Tiger is passionate about tracking the music he loves—and that’s exactly what this project is all about.</p>
		<p>The name RIAT was inspired by the Recording Industry Association of America® (RIAA). Similar to the RIAA, RIAT features gold and platinum-certified albums and songs, while it also incorporates weekly chart elements like the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 charts. Simply put, RIAT uses Play Points (derived from the number of plays) and Chart Points (earned through weekly chart performance) to calculate RIAT Units. So far, it has tracked every #1 / gold-certified album and top 3 / gold-certified song since June 2018, when Tiger started using Last.fm.</p>
		<p>
			RIAT began in 2020 as a single spreadsheet for temporary data storage. Today, it has grown into a robust, dynamic system with:
			<br>· 14 active sheets for different display purposes
			<br>· About 500 artists, 600 albums, and 2,000 songs
			<br>· Advanced filtering by artist, decade, year, and more
		</p>
		<p>Powered by advanced Google Sheets functions and custom JavaScript programs, RIAT integrates with Last.fm and Spotify APIs for real-time synchronization. Play counts now update automatically every hour, reflecting Tiger’s most recent listening activity. Check out RIAT here.</p>
