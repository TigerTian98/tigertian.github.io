			Is it narcissistic to have a personal website, or is it the exact opposite? If you think about it, everything presented there is intended to impress you.
			<br>
			<br>
			But what if you think of it this way: each of us is just one of the eight billion people in the world - let that sink in - and you're here reading this for a reason. This is your opportunity to take a close look at one of those eight billion people, and decide whether you like him or not. Hopefully this point in time makes a difference to what will happen in the future, and hopefully if you've never met him before, it makes a good first impression on his behalf, too.
			<br>
			<br>
			So, ‰Ω†Â•Ω! I'm Tiger's personal website, and it's very nice to have you here. "Tiger" is obviously (and fortunately) not his legal name, but he was born in the year of the Tiger, so it's been his nickname all his life. Tian is his surname - try sounding "T-N" really fast, and you just pronounced it correctly.
			<br>
			<br>
			What Tiger would like you to know about him, before anything else, is how much he loves music. He listens to music intensively and is a devoted record collector and concert-goer. He writes about music he likes and has a blog where he posts his articles (mostly in Chinese, his native language) and designs visuals for them. He creates original music and has composed, produced, and recorded a few mixtapes himself. I could go on and on about his passion for music, but my other sections probably do a better job in showcasing that.
			<br>
			<br>
			Tiger is currently pursuing a master degree in Music Business. As he came from a Computer Science and Interactive Media Arts background, a career in the music industry once sounded incredibly cool but also kind of unrealistic; you can imagine the determination it took for him to finally switch paths. That said, he believes those majors combined artistic expression and algorithmic thinking perfectly, without which he wouldn't have made projects that embody both. Here you can find some of the best ones, including me (this website).
			<br>
			<br>
			Some essential and interesting facts about Tiger:
			<br>¬∑ He was born and raised in Ê∑±Âú≥ Shenzhen, China, a city in Âπø‰∏ú Guangdong province, but he is not Cantonese;
			<br>¬∑ He has never had a drop of alcohol so far in his life;
			<br>¬∑ His favorite seasons are summer, fall, and winter;
			<br>¬∑ The first music video he saw on MTV in fifth grade, if he remembers correctly, was "All the Lovers" by Kylie Minogue;
			<br>¬∑ He has heard "Into You" by Ariana Grande live twice (so far);
			<br>¬∑ He is an extrovert with introverts, but an introvert with extroverts;
			<br>¬∑ His pronouns are he/him.
			<br>
			<br>
			I hope you'll find more interesting things about Tiger on this website. Maybe you're visiting from the other side of the planet, or maybe you're sitting next to him at this moment; either way, thank you for taking the time to get here.
